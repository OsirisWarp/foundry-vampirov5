It has been possible thanks to the great <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/rolnl/sandbox-system-builder/\">Sandbox</a> created by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RolNL\">Seregras</a>.</p>\n<p>The creator of this baby is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Musrha\">Musrha</a>, who you can contact on Twitter or through Discord (<strong>Musrha#8789</strong>).</p>\n<p>Thank you very much to Seregras himself for making this possible, to the Discord of <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8ncSrcr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rol NL</a>, to the Official Discord of <a href=\"https://discord.gg/AQZd8PG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foundry VTT</a> as well as the girls and boys of the <a href=\"https://discord.com/9GGZvh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foundry VTT Espa&ntilde;ol</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of the icons come from <a href=\"https://game-icons.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Game-Icons.net</a>, but the clan and discipline icons belong to White Wolf.</p>\n<p id=\"tw-target-text\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Translation\"><span lang=\"en\">This file has been created without any kind of profit motive and is uploaded to the public in a disinterested and free way, any request of withdrawal by the holders of the rights will be attended as soon as possible.</span></p>\n<h1>Configuration</h1>\n<p>Folders that start with \"_\" like \"_TEMPLATES\" and \"_COMPENDIUM\" are system folders that shouldn't be modified unless you are very conscious of what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Inside \"_COMPENDIUM\" there are three folders that you will use to create the files: cItems, DISCIPLINES and Advantages and Defects. Being able to drag these cItems to include them to different parts of the file. You can create the folders you need apart from the existing ones to save your characters, items and everything you need.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15.75px;\"><strong>How to create a character?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15.75px;\">In the Actor tab you must click on Create Actor, and in the dropdown you must change \"Default\" to \"PC template\" (do not check the Template box) to see the changes. If you drag the cItem \"Creation\" to the character, you will be able to choose the Clan and the Predator so that their corresponding cItems are put on the token, as well as the Blood Rapture</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bio </strong>is the tab where you can put everything you consider about the character, such as images, history, description and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Main </strong>is the tab where the Attributes, Skills and what you will use the most during the game are located. All the texts that are in bold can be clicked to make a roll, as well as the dice symbols that you find in this and other tabs. Below I will explain how to make runs and a couple of considerations to take into account about this tab. If you drag the Clan and the Predator from the cItems you will see how they appear on the card.</li>\n<li><strong>Disciplines </strong>is where all the powers, disciplines, and the PC's Blood Potency part is. If you drag the disciplines and the corresponding powers will appear. Below I will also explain how to make the Discipline rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronicle </strong>is the tab where you will put, among other things, the Advantages and Disadvantages. You must also drag them from the cItems so that they appear on the screen and assign them the corresponding score, as well as the experience. If a character has Refugee Merits / Refugee Defects or is a Weak Blood you will see new panels appear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, now I will explain the less intuitive mechanics of the token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to Roll (Primary):</strong> All Vampire V5 rolls are Attribute + Attribute, Attribute + Skill, or Attribute + Discipline. For the first two cases, we must select the main attribute in the 'attribute' drop-down and then click on the corresponding attribute or ability. For example, to roll Skill + Streetwise you would have to mark in the drop-down menu 'Skill' and then click on the black text of 'Streetwise'. The number of successes will be counted and compared to the Difficulty (DC) that you can check in the box below.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunger:</strong> The token automatically rolls Hunger dice based on the amount you have marked. The first dice rolled will be Hunger and then normal. In the info of the roll you will see each type of dice broken down so that you can calculate the Conflicting Critics and bestial failures, which cannot yet be automated.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat rolls with Willpower:</strong> Now you must subtract the Willpower manually, but when you do so, you will only have to put the number of dice in the Repeat FS box (maximum 3) and then click on the text so that the number is rolled corresponding dice.</li>\n<li><strong>Outburst of Blood / Specialties:</strong> By clicking on the text of Outburst we will make the corresponding Burning test. Once we do it, you just have to click on the Rapture or Specialty box so that +1 is added to the dice pool (+2 if both are marked).</li>\n<li><strong>How to Roll (Disciplines):</strong> Discipline powers that require a roll usually have one or more options, so I've designed the system so that it can be done anyway. To shoot, we must write the corresponding combination in the boxes of 'Attribute 1' and 'Attribute 2', always in lower case and without spaces. There are two exceptions: Weak Blood Alchemy and Blood Sorcery are rolled by typing 'alchemy' and 'sorcery', respectively. For example, to roll Resolution + Firearms it would be necessary to put 'resolution' in Attribute 1 and 'firearms' in Attribute 2, always without quotes. Additionally, PCs with Blood Sorcery at 1st level or higher will see a table appear for Rituals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Coming soon...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Differentiate superficial damage from Aggravated damage.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And much more as Sandbox progresses.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>And I think that's it. I hope you enjoy the file, that you send me your doubts, suggestions and requests ... and that you give a lot to the best edition of Vampire: The Masquerade that has been made to date. :)</p>","img":""}
