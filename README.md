Sheet and system of **Vampire: The Masquerade V5 (Fifth Edition)** using [Sandbox](https://gitlab.com/rolnl/sandbox-system-builder/) from [Seregras](https://www.youtube.com/c/RolNL/).

In the Journal you will find a ** Read me ** where you will find a small guide on how to use the card correctly, in addition to the credits.

I recommend that you install it with this link to [world.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Musrha/foundry-vampirov5/master/world.json) from **Game Worlds** and putting the link in *Manifest Url*.

I hope you enjoy it! You can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Musrha) and Discord (** Musrha # 8789 **) for any bug, suggestion or whatever.

Just making a fork to try and convert to English.
